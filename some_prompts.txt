plot illustrates K-means clustering with three clusters:
    - The x and y axes represent two features of the data points.
    - Each point is colored according to its assigned cluster.
    - The three large red X marks represent the centroids of each cluster.
    - The scatter of points shows clear separation between the three clusters.
