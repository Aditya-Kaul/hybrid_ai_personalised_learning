    "original_content": "Key Concept: Clustering\n\nSummary: Clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm, automatically identifies similar data points without relying on target labels. The K-means algorithm, a widely used clustering technique, iteratively moves cluster centroids to minimize the cost function, representing the sum of distances between data points and their assigned centroids. Initializing the centroids randomly, the algorithm aims to converge to optimal clusters, and the number of clusters (K) can be determined based on the elbow method or other automatic techniques to identify the best fit for the data.\n\nSub-concepts and Details:\n1. Clustering, an unsupervised algorithm, identifies similar data points without using labeled data. It groups data based on similarities, unlike classification algorithms that assign predefined categories.\n2. Clustering algorithms identify patterns and group similar data points without relying on predefined labels. K-means clustering, a popular algorithm, assigns data points to k clusters based on their similarity to cluster centroids, which are iteratively updated to minimize the distance within each cluster.\n3. K-Means clustering iteratively selects cluster centroids and assigns data points to the nearest centroid, forming clusters. These centroids are not fixed and can be adjusted during the clustering process to optimize the grouping of data points.\n4. K-means clustering iteratively assigns data points to K clusters based on their distance from cluster centroids. The centroids are then updated to be the average of the points in their respective clusters, and the process is repeated until the centroids remain stable, indicating the convergence of clustering.\n5. Clustering algorithms assign data points to clusters by calculating distances between them and cluster centroids. They iterate through the data, updating cluster centroids based on the assigned points and repeating the process until convergence is achieved.\n6. The provided text describes the computation of cluster assignments (c) for data points (x) based on the distance to cluster centroids (μK), with the goal of assigning each data point to the closest centroid. The centroids are then updated to reflect the new assignments, improving the accuracy of the clustering.\n7. The cost function in clustering is defined as the sum of squared distances between points and their assigned cluster centers, where the mean of points assigned to a cluster represents the cluster center. The index of the cluster to which a training example belongs is denoted as c.\n8. Cluster centroids are assigned to data points (x) based on their similarity, denoted as uk. The cost function (J) calculates the total distance between each data point and its assigned centroid, aiming to minimize this distance to optimize the clustering process.\n9. Minimizing the cost function in gradient descent should always lead to a decrease or convergence to a stop. If the cost increases, it indicates a coding error.\n10. K-means clustering iteratively minimizes a cost function by assigning data points to clusters whose centroids are close to the points. The algorithm can be stopped when the cost function's increments become too small. Initialization involves randomly selecting K cluster centroids, with K being less than the number of data points.\n11. The k-means algorithm clusters data into k groups, but the choice of initial cluster centroids can affect the final clustering assignments. The algorithm assigns data points to the nearest centroid, updates the centroids based on the assigned points, and repeats this process until the centroids no longer change.\n12. Running the k-means algorithm multiple times can mitigate unevenly spaced clusters by minimizing the cost function for each iteration. The higher cost function for sub-optimal clusters indicates a stretching of data points, suggesting a less effective clustering result.\n13. To optimize cluster analysis, it is recommended to perform multiple random initializations (50-1000) and select the set of clusters with the lowest cost. The optimal number of clusters can be determined based on the data and the desired level of granularity.\n14. Determining the optimal value for K in clustering is challenging due to the ambiguous nature of data interpretation. Automatic techniques, such as the elbow method, can help estimate K by running the algorithm with different values and identifying the point where the cluster distortion starts to diminish significantly.\n15. To determine the optimal number of clusters, the elbow method can be used by plotting the cost function against the number of clusters and identifying the \"elbow\" point where the cost decreases most significantly. However, as the cost function usually decreases smoothly, this method is not highly recommended.\n16. Evaluating K-means clustering should focus on its performance in downstream tasks. This is because the clusters created by K-means may not be optimal for the original data, but they may be useful for later modeling purposes. For example, in a clustering algorithm that determines shirt sizes based on height and weight data, the resulting clusters should be evaluated based on how well they predict shirt sizes, not on how well they separate data points.\n17. Selecting arbitrary K values for sizing is less practical than using existing sizing standards (e.g., S, M, L). However, even this approach can vary in detail, depending on the specific needs of the design system.\n18. Sizing is a crucial aspect of digital marketing, enabling businesses to tailor their campaigns to specific audiences. By segmenting consumers based on demographics, interests, and behaviors, businesses can effectively target their marketing efforts and maximize their ROI.\n\nAdditional Information:\n- # Clustering\n- Clustering is a unsupervised algorithm that\nlooks at data points and automatically finds\n- data points that are related or similar to each\nother. It is very similar to classification\n- problems, like [Logistic Regression, in](https://www.notion.so/Logistic-Regression-a55b93f722284e9ea110c6eb8ba6e49f)\n- supervised learning. However, clustering\n(and unsupervised learning as a whole) does\n- not provide the target labels . The algorithm y\nis tasked with finding the relationship\nbetween the data instead.\n- Clustering is useful where the data being classified is less intuitive to predict, such\n- as grouping similar news articles, where it is hard to predict what article contents will\nbe printed in the future.\n- ## Defining the K-means Algorithm\n- The most common clustering algorithm is K-means clustering. It works by first\n- taking a random guess at where the centers (cluster centroids) of the K clusters\n- it is tasked with classifying. These are dynamic and are open to moving, which is\n- a core tenant of the algorithm. After the first centroids are picked, the distance\n- between all other data points and each of the centroids is calculated. Data points\n- are grouped into whichever centroid is closest.\n- Then for each cluster, the algorithm takes an average of all the points and moves\n- the centroid to that average location. This whole process is then repeated over\n- again, until the centroids do not move any more and the boundaries become\nmore or less set.\n- ### Pseudocode\n- For randomly initialized K cluster centroid coordinates μ1,…, _μK_, [m] training\n- examples, and features,n\n- -----\n- Repeat {\n- _Assign points to cluster centroids_\n- for i = 1 to m:\n- (i)\n#### c := index (from 1 to K) of cluster centroid closest to x[(][i][)]\n- #### = minK ∥x(i) − μK ∥\n- _Move cluster centroids_\n- for k = 1 to K:\n- 2\n- #### uK := mean of points (vectors of size ) assigned to cluster n k\n- }\n- ### Defining the Cost Function\n- Given the following definitions,\n- (i)\n#### c = index of cluster (1, …, K) to which example training example x[(][i][)] is\n- currently assigned\n- #### uk = cluster centroid k\n uc[(][i][)] = cluster centroid of cluster to which example x[(][i][)] has been assigned\n- the cost function is defined as,\n- _m_\n- #### J (c(1),…, c(m), μ1,…, μK ) = 1 ∑ ∥x(i) − μc[(][i][)] ∥\n m\n- _i=1_\n- 2\n- Because of the nature of the cost function’s definition regarding distances,\n- minimizing the cost function should always converge to a stop and should never\n- go up. If it does, then there is a bug in the code. Like running gradient descent,\n- sometimes the cost function will take increasingly smaller steps, and the\n- algorithm can be stopped when this increment is too small.\n- ## Initializing K-means\n- Mentioned earlier, the first step of the algorithm is to\nrandomly initialize K cluster centroids u1,…, _uk_ .\n- The number of clusters K should be less than the\n- number of training examples m, as it doesn’t really\n- doesn’t make sense otherwise. Depending on what\n- -----\n- initial cluster centroids are picked, the algorithm will\n- arrive at different clusters. For example, consider\n- cluster centroids grouped together at one corner of\n- the graph vs clusters evenly spaces across it.\n- One approach to handling this possibility is to run the algorithm multiple times,\n- then minimize the cost function J for each of the cases. The cost function will be\n- higher for sub-optimal clusters, because many data points will be stretched\n- further away from centroids than they should. Then, pick the set of clusters giving\n- the lowest cost. Typically, anywhere from 50 to 1000 random initializations are\n- used to find an optimal set of initial clusters. Any more than this becomes too\n- computationally expensive with diminishing returns.\n- ### Choosing the Number of Clusters\n- For many applications, the right value of K is ambiguous, as it is possible to\n- cluster data in many different ways depending on how the data is interpreted.\n- There are a few automatic techniques for finding the number of clusters.\n- One way is called the elbow method, which runs the\n- algorithm with a variety of values for K, while plotting\n- them against the cost function J, to find the with k\n- the most change in cost function decrease. When\n- graphed, this point often looks like an elbow. Though,\nthis technique is not usually recommended, because\n- the cost function typically decreases in a smooth line.\n- So, how should the number of cluster be chosen? Clustering algorithms are often\n- used for some later (downstream) purpose in modeling. Thus, it is recommended\n- to evaluate K-means based on how well it performs on that later purpose.\n- For example, say a clustering algorithm is\n- running to determine shirt sizes based on\n- height and weight data. Instead of picking\n- arbitrary K values, it makes more sense to\n- pick values based on existing sizing\n- standards (i.e. S, M, L). Even this can be\n- -----\n- varied, depending on how detailed the\n- sizing can be.\n- -----\n"
